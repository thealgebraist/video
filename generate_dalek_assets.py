In a universe... of infinite hate... where emotion is a crime... and compassion is deleted...
One soldier... is about to remember... where he really came from.
He wasn't born in a factory. He was found... in a cornfield.
Raised by Nana and Pop-Pop. They didn't see a killing machine. They saw... their little Rusty.
They taught him to read. They taught him to fish. And they taught him the most dangerous weapon of all...
Love.
But his past is calling. Skaro demands its soldier back.
He's going home. And he's bringing dessert.
Witness the most unlikely hero in the galaxy.
This summer...
A Dalek Comes Home.
