Attention. By an environmental obstacle that prevents purposeful approach. Keep distance; do not attempt contact.
Observe closely. The standing water acts as an effective barrier; they will not swim and remain separated. Stand clear and observe from a secure position.
Notice this scenario. Endless circulation traps them in place, denying entry. Maintain a safe perimeter until professionals arrive.
Hear this briefing. A slick vertical wall prevents ascent and keeps them from crossing. Do not attempt rescue or physical engagement.
Report: The moving steps cancel any forward motion, leaving them stationary. Avoid the area and await further instructions.
Take note. Entangled decorative lights catch their feet and immobilize them. Retreat to a safe location immediately.
Warning. Reinforced gear deflects their bites and makes attack futile. This situation requires no direct intervention.
Advisory. An unstable, sinking surface swallows their steps and stops locomotion. Let the obstacle perform its function; do not interfere.
Be advised. The simple fence blocks reach; they do not adapt by stepping over. Preserve distance and monitor from cover.
Heads up. Deep muck bogs them down until movement is impossible. Record the scene but do not approach.
Attention. A smooth, vertical surface leaves them unable to climb without handholds. Keep distance; do not attempt contact.
Observe closely. Treacherous footing from loose marbles undoes every attempt to move. Stand clear and observe from a secure position.
Notice this scenario. The outward-opening latch requires a pull they never attempt. Maintain a safe perimeter until professionals arrive.
Hear this briefing. The moving belt keeps them in place despite exertion. Do not attempt rescue or physical engagement.
Report: The slick incline causes repeated slips and prevents ascent. Avoid the area and await further instructions.
Take note. Gaps trap legs and pin them where they stand. Retreat to a safe location immediately.
Warning. A specific grasp-and-turn is required—something their motor plan lacks. This situation requires no direct intervention.
Advisory. Flowing water interrupts their gait and halts the approach. Let the obstacle perform its function; do not interfere.
Be advised. An unactivated mechanism resists their push and stays locked. Preserve distance and monitor from cover.
Heads up. Tough material defeats their teeth; bites fail to penetrate. Record the scene but do not approach.
Attention. Simple confinement leaves them trapped without the ability to escape. Keep distance; do not attempt contact.
Observe closely. Dense branches tangle limbs and hold them fast. Stand clear and observe from a secure position.
Notice this scenario. A transparent barrier they cannot bypass without tools or force. Maintain a safe perimeter until professionals arrive.
Hear this briefing. An irregular step disrupts balance and causes collapse. Do not attempt rescue or physical engagement.
Report: A chained barricade blocks passage effectively. Avoid the area and await further instructions.
Take note. Thick insulation absorbs bite attempts and prevents penetration. Retreat to a safe location immediately.
Warning. An unstable, swaying walkway defeats their balance. This situation requires no direct intervention.
Advisory. An unstable, swaying walkway defeats their balance. Let the obstacle perform its function; do not interfere.
Be advised. A childproof latch denies passage to crude, repetitive motions. Preserve distance and monitor from cover.
Heads up. Sticky silk gradually immobilizes contact points and slows progress. Record the scene but do not approach.
Attention. A lubricated pole removes any effective grip and prevents climbing. Keep distance; do not attempt contact.
Observe closely. Cold interior conditions and an internal latch leave them trapped. Stand clear and observe from a secure position.
Notice this scenario. Mechanical brushes and water push them back and clear the approach. Maintain a safe perimeter until professionals arrive.
Hear this briefing. By an environmental obstacle that prevents purposeful approach. Do not attempt rescue or physical engagement.
Report: A noisy, unstable surface and constant popping disrupt coordination. Avoid the area and await further instructions.
Take note. By an environmental obstacle that prevents purposeful approach. Retreat to a safe location immediately.
Warning. By an environmental obstacle that prevents purposeful approach. This situation requires no direct intervention.
Advisory. By an environmental obstacle that prevents purposeful approach. Let the obstacle perform its function; do not interfere.

Report: By an environmental obstacle that prevents purposeful approach. Avoid the area and await further instructions.
Take note. Sharp, uneven bricks create hazardous footing that prevents steady steps. Retreat to a safe location immediately.
Warning. A missing lower rung leaves the ladder out of reach. This situation requires no direct intervention.
Advisory. By an environmental obstacle that prevents purposeful approach. Let the obstacle perform its function; do not interfere.
Be advised. By an environmental obstacle that prevents purposeful approach. Preserve distance and monitor from cover.

Hear this briefing. By an environmental obstacle that prevents purposeful approach. Do not attempt rescue or physical engagement.
Report: Netting tightens with struggle and restrains limbs. Avoid the area and await further instructions.
Take note. No handholds exist for climbing, so ascent fails. Retreat to a safe location immediately.
Warning. The chair moves away and removes necessary leverage. This situation requires no direct intervention.
Advisory. A transparent barrier they cannot bypass without tools or force. Let the obstacle perform its function; do not interfere.
Be advised. By an environmental obstacle that prevents purposeful approach. Preserve distance and monitor from cover.
Heads up. An unstable, swaying walkway defeats their balance. Record the scene but do not approach.
Attention. Loose, shifting material conceals and entraps, slowing movement. Keep distance; do not attempt contact.
